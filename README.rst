Rust-Gron

:Credits: gron_

Gron transforms JSON into discrete assignments to make it easier to grep for
what you want and see the absolute 'path' to it. It eases the exploration of
APIs that return large blobs of JSON.

This is a reimplementation of the library in Rust because I need to embed
it into a daemon written in rust.
